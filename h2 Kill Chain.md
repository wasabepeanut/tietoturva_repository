# x) Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains
## 1 Introduction
- A new group of threats known as "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT) are exploiting the common security measures to attack the systems
- The new threats are using advanced technology build to defeat the most common defense mechanisms
- To defend against these threats, it is necessary to build a defense based on the threats and attack patterns
- Mapping each attack to their own category and choosing the right defense method against them is the key to reducing and eliminating the threats

- Most organizations rely on solutions that reduce risks related to automated threats, which might not be the best defense against manually operated attacks
- Common incident response methods fail because of two inaccurate assumptions:
  - They react only after the attacks has gone through, which in some cases might be too late
  - They assume that the attack relies only on specific vulnerabilites and ignore the adaptive and cunning methods of an attack
- Responding to APT attacks required more advanced and intelligent solutions, thus introducing "kill chain" an approach to threats from the attackers perspective where each individual phase of an attack was mapped to their own category
- Following the guide, the defenders could acquire an advantage over the attacks by anticipating the next moves and preparing a defense.

- Attack-Based Sequential Analysis of Countermeasures (ABSAC)
  - Approach that offers solutions based on the countermeasures rather than the early detection of an attack
- Situational Crime Prevention (SCP)
  - Approach models crime from the offender' perspective and maps the phases of a crime
 
## 3 Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense
- A strategy that responds to threats, and analyses their capabilities, objectives and limitations
- Treats the intrusions as phased progressions using a kill chain model to analyze the intrusions and preparing defenses against them
- The strategy yields a more secure defense measures by mapping each intrusion to their own phase. In the kill chain breaking even one phase of the intrusion terminates the threat
