# a)
I think the most important task that helped me improve were tasks h1 and h2. After those tasks I had gotten better at writing the context of my tasks and really focus on the most important parts of some articles. 
I also started to write my references better after those tasks and also provide some graphical content to support my text. 

h1: https://github.com/wasabepeanut/tietoturva_repository/blob/main/h1%20Should%20Tero%20wear%20a%20helmet%3F_task.md

h2: https://github.com/wasabepeanut/tietoturva_repository/blob/main/h2%20Kill%20Chain.md


# b)
