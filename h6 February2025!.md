# One-Way Functions
- A core element of public-key cryptography. 
- Are difficult to reverse, compared to how they are determined.
- Example from the book shortened: It is easy to break a plate, but not as easy to put the broken    pieces together.
- Technically, one-way functions might not be real, but many functions seem that way. E.g. Fixing
  a broken plate might not be impossible, but is really difficult.
- Trapdoor one-way function: one-way function that makes the difficult part achievable with secret
  information.

# One-Way Hash Functions
- A core element in modern cryptography.
