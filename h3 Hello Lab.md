# Installing Debian and Command Lines Basics
- By following the instructions, I succesfully downloaded and learned how to download Debian on my virtual machine
- I also succeeded in installing the optional features following the same instructions. (Karvinen 22.1.2021)

- Basic commands that everyone should know and are useful for navigating and operating in the Linux command line (CMD):
    - pwd = tells you the current directory you are working in
    - ls = lists the content
    - cd = changing directiories
    - mv = moving and renaming files/directories
    - cp = copy a file/directory
    - rm = remove a file/directory
- It is possible to get the description and help on a command by typing "man" and the command you want help with
- By applying "sudo" at the start of a command, you gain "high privilege" which allows you to make operations requiring admin rights
- It is important to get the latest available features on your system, by giving the command "sudo apt-get update", which updates the system by installing the latest available packages. (Karvinen 3.2.2020)
